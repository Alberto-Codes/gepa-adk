# Story 1B.6: Migrate to Trunk-Based Development on Main and Release 1.0.0

Status: review
Branch: chore/1b-6-migrate-trunk-based-main-release-1-0-0

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a library maintainer,
I want the repository migrated from develop-based branching to main as the default branch with a 1.0.0 release,
So that the project follows standard open-source conventions, the publish pipeline triggers cleanly from main, and the stable API is signaled to consumers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **`main` exists and contains current `develop` content** — `main` branch is created from `develop` and contains all current code at the point of migration.
2. **All CI workflows reference `main` instead of `develop`** — `tests.yml`, `boundaries.yml`, `release-please.yml`, `publish.yml`, `test-publish.yml`, `docs.yml`, `codeql.yml` all use `main` as the primary trigger branch. `develop` references are removed from workflow trigger branches.
3. **`release-please-config.json` contains `bootstrap-sha`** — Points to the migration merge commit so release-please only considers post-migration commits for the 1.0.0 changelog.
4. **CHANGELOG.md curated** — A "Foundation (0.x Series)" section summarizes pre-1.0 history. The auto-generated 0.x entries remain but are clearly separated from the 1.0.0+ section.
5. **release-please creates 1.0.0 release PR** — After `bootstrap-sha` is set and the first conventional commit lands on `main`, release-please produces a 1.0.0 release PR automatically.
6. **GitHub default branch set to `main`** — `origin/HEAD` points to `main`. Contributors are guided to target `main` for PRs.
7. **Branch protection on `main`** — Matches current `develop` protections (require PR review, require status checks to pass, no force push).
8. **Dependabot targets `main`** — Both GitHub Actions and uv package ecosystem entries in `.github/dependabot.yml` target `main`.
9. **Documentation updated** — `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/contributing/releasing.md`, `docs/concepts/workflow-agents.md`, `README.md` (badges/links), `mkdocs.yml` (`edit_uri`), and any other docs referencing `develop` as the primary branch are updated to `main`.
10. **No test behavior changes** — All existing tests pass. Coverage stays above 85%.
11. **`develop` branch archived** — After Phase 2 is confirmed green, `develop` is deleted or archived. All open PRs targeting `develop` are retargeted to `main` or closed with explanation (including the existing `release-please--branches--develop` PR and any dependabot PRs).
12. **Post-migration CI verification** — A no-op or bootstrap commit on `main` triggers all CI workflows and they pass green, confirming the branch trigger migration is complete.

  - [x] 7.3 Pre-commit: deferred (ruff checks passed, no source code changes)
  - [x] 7.4 All changed files reviewed — no accidental "develop" verb replacements
  - [x] 7.5 Final sweep clean — only remaining `develop` refs are: mermaid.instructions.md (gitGraph syntax example, not project-specific) and pr.create.prompt.md `--base develop` example (intentional: shows how to override default `main` base)

### Phase 2: Post-Merge Manual Steps (after Phase 1 PR merged to `develop`)

- [ ] Task 8: Create `main` branch (AC: 1, 6)
  - [ ] 8.1 `git checkout develop && git pull origin develop` — ensure local develop is up to date
  - [ ] 8.2 `git checkout -b main` — create main from develop
  - [ ] 8.3 `git push -u origin main` — push main to remote
  - [ ] 8.4 On GitHub: Settings > General > Default Branch > change to `main`
  - [ ] 8.5 Verify `origin/HEAD` points to `main`: `git remote show origin | grep "HEAD branch"`

- [ ] Task 9: Apply branch protection (AC: 7)
  - [ ] 9.1 On GitHub: Settings > Branches > Add rule for `main`
  - [ ] 9.2 Enable: Require a pull request before merging (1 approver)
  - [ ] 9.3 Enable: Require status checks to pass (tests, boundaries, type-check)
  - [ ] 9.4 Enable: Do not allow force pushes
  - [ ] 9.5 Enable: Do not allow deletions
  - [ ] 9.6 Copy any additional protections from current `develop` rules

- [ ] Task 10: Bootstrap release-please for 1.0.0 (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] 10.1 Get the merge commit SHA: `git log --oneline -1 main` — this is the bootstrap SHA
  - [ ] 10.2 Edit `release-please-config.json` on `main`: add `"bootstrap-sha": "<SHA>"` at the top level
  - [ ] 10.3 Commit and push: `git add release-please-config.json && git commit -m "chore(release): set bootstrap-sha for 1.0.0"` and push to main
  - [ ] 10.4 Verify release-please creates a release PR with version 1.0.0 (may require a feat/fix commit to trigger)

- [ ] Task 11: Verify CI on `main` (AC: 12)
  - [ ] 11.1 After Task 10.3 push, verify all 8 CI workflows trigger and pass green on `main`: tests, boundaries, release-please, codeql, docs, publish, test-publish, copilot-setup-steps
  - [ ] 11.2 Verify the ADK version matrix (1.20.0 + latest) runs correctly in `tests.yml` on `main`
  - [ ] 11.3 Check `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs` for stale release-please refs pointing to `develop`

- [ ] Task 12: Clean up `develop` branch and open PRs (AC: 11)
  - [ ] 12.1 Close the existing `release-please--branches--develop--components--gepa-adk` PR with explanation
  - [ ] 12.2 Close or retarget any open dependabot PRs targeting `develop`
  - [ ] 12.3 Retarget any other open PRs from `develop` to `main`
  - [ ] 12.4 After confirming `main` is stable: delete `develop` branch on GitHub (`gh api -X DELETE repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs/heads/develop`)
  - [ ] 12.5 Update local git: `git remote set-head origin main && git branch -D develop`

## Dev Notes

### Release Strategy Context

This is the planned release sequence for Epic 1B completion:
- **Story 1B.6** (this story) → merges to `develop`, then `main` is created → triggers **1.0.0** release
- **Story 1B.5** (ty type-narrowing) → PR targets `main` directly (first PR after migration) → **1.0.1** patch release (`refactor`/`fix` type)
- **Epic 1B closed** after 1B.5 completes
- **Epic 2** stories → `feat` commits on `main` → **1.1.0**, **1.2.0**, etc.

This means the Phase 1 PR is the **last PR to `develop`**. After Phase 1 merges, no more conventional commits should land on `develop` — Phase 2 executes immediately. This eliminates any risk of semver confusion from removing `bump-minor-pre-major` in Phase 1.

### Two-Phase Architecture

This story uses a **two-phase execution model**:

- **Phase 1** is a standard code PR to `develop` — all file changes (CI workflows, docs, configs) are made here. This is the DEV agent's primary scope. After PR merge, `develop` contains all the updated configs pointing to `main`.
- **Phase 2** is a set of manual GitHub operations performed by the maintainer AFTER Phase 1 merges. Creating `main` from `develop` at this point means `main` inherits all the updated configs already pointing to itself.

This ordering prevents a chicken-and-egg problem: if we created `main` first, CI workflows would still reference `develop`. By updating configs first (Phase 1), then creating `main` (Phase 2), everything is self-consistent from the moment `main` exists.

**Phase 1 task parallelism:** Tasks 1-6 are independent of each other (touch different files). Only Task 7 (validation) depends on all others completing. The dev agent can execute Tasks 1-6 in any order or in parallel.

### release-please Bootstrap Strategy

The `bootstrap-sha` mechanism tells release-please: "start tracking conventional commits from THIS commit forward." Without it, release-please would try to generate a changelog from the entire develop history (hundreds of commits). Setting the bootstrap SHA to the migration merge commit means 1.0.0 gets a clean changelog containing only post-migration work.

**Current state:**
- `release-please-config.json` has `"bump-minor-pre-major": true` and `"bump-patch-for-minor-pre-major": true` — these cause `feat` to bump patch (not minor) and `fix` to also bump patch while version < 1.0.0
- `.release-please-manifest.json` shows version `0.3.5`
- `release-please.yml` currently triggers on `develop` pushes
- There's an existing release-please PR branch: `release-please--branches--develop--components--gepa-adk`

**After migration:**
- Remove pre-major bump settings — post-1.0.0, standard semver applies (`feat` → minor, `fix` → patch)
- Bootstrap SHA resets the commit window
- First conventional commit to `main` triggers a 1.0.0 release PR

### Files Changed Inventory

**CI Workflows (4 files):**
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.github/workflows/tests.yml` | `branches: [develop, main]` → `branches: [main]` |
| `.github/workflows/boundaries.yml` | `branches: [develop, main]` → `branches: [main]` |
| `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` | `branches: - develop` → `branches: - main` |
| `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` | `branches: [main, develop]` → `branches: [main]` (2 locations) |

**Config (2 files):**
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.github/dependabot.yml` | `target-branch: "develop"` → `target-branch: "main"` (2 locations) |
| `release-please-config.json` | Remove `bump-minor-pre-major`, `bump-patch-for-minor-pre-major` |

**Documentation (5-7 files):**
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | `develop` → `main` (3 locations) |
| `docs/contributing/releasing.md` | `develop` → `main` (3-4 locations), rewrite release process |
| `docs/concepts/workflow-agents.md` | `tree/develop/examples` → `tree/main/examples` |
| `README.md` | Check badges/links for `develop` branch encoding |
| `mkdocs.yml` | Check `edit_uri` for `edit/develop/docs/` |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Add "Foundation (0.x Series)" summary section |

**Project config (2 files):**
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.claude/rules/pull-requests.md` | CRITICAL: `Main branch... develop` → `Main branch... main` |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Update if references develop |

### Risk Assessment

**Lowest risk:** Phase 1 file changes — all mechanical find-and-replace of branch names. Zero code logic changes. All tests remain unchanged.

**Medium risk:** release-please bootstrap — if `bootstrap-sha` is set incorrectly, release-please may generate an incomplete or empty changelog. Mitigation: verify with `gh api` that release-please recognizes the bootstrap state.

**Highest risk:** Phase 2 GitHub operations — changing default branch affects all open PRs, dependabot, and contributor workflows. Mitigation: announce the migration, update open PRs, verify CI runs green on `main` before deleting `develop`.

**NOT a risk:** The `type-check.yml` workflow — it was referenced in project-context.md but doesn't exist as a separate file. Type checking appears to be part of the `tests.yml` or pre-commit pipeline. Verified by the workflow file listing.

### Previous Story Learnings (from Story 1B.4)

1. **Line numbers are advisory** — Prior stories shifted code. Use grep patterns, not hardcoded line numbers.
2. **Documentation subtasks are mandatory** — docstrings, CONTRIBUTING.md, and examples must be updated as part of AC, not afterthoughts.
3. **Pre-commit hooks are strict** — Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing.
4. **Clean sweep at the end** — Story 1B.4 added a grep sweep (Task 10.5.5) to catch stale references. This story should do the same for `develop` references.
5. **No story refs in production code** — Don't reference "Story 1B.6" in src/ files.

### Architectural Gotchas

- **Do NOT change `develop` in prose that means "developer"** — Many docs use "develop" as a verb (e.g., "develop features"). Only change branch-name references. Use context to distinguish. Common false positives: "develop new features", "development workflow", "developer experience".
- **BMAD config doesn't use branch names** — `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` references artifact paths, not git branches. No changes expected there.
- **Dependabot PRs** — After migration, existing dependabot PRs targeting `develop` will need to be closed. New ones will target `main`.
- **release-please branch** — The existing `release-please--branches--develop--components--gepa-adk` branch/PR should be closed after migration.
- **`.claude/rules/pull-requests.md` is the highest-impact single change** — This file controls dev agent behavior for ALL future stories. If not updated, Story 1B.5's dev agent will create PRs targeting the dead `develop` branch.
- **`publish.yml` may have GitHub Environment protection** — The file itself uses tag triggers (no `develop` reference), but check GitHub Settings > Environments for any deployment protection rules tied to `develop`.
- **GitHub Actions `edit_uri` in mkdocs** — The "Edit on GitHub" button in docs uses `edit_uri` which may encode `develop`. If missed, docs will link to a dead branch.

### CHANGELOG Foundation Section Draft

Use this as the starting point for Task 4.2 (dev agent should refine wording):

```markdown
<!-- 1.0.0 releases begin above this line -->

## Foundation (0.x Series)

The 0.x series established the core architecture and capabilities of gepa-adk:

- **Hexagonal Architecture** (ADR-000) — Clean separation into domain, ports, adapters, and engine layers with CI-enforced boundary checking
- **Async-First Design** (ADR-001) — All core APIs are async with sync wrappers only at the API surface
- **Protocol-Based Ports** — All interfaces use `typing.Protocol` with `@runtime_checkable` for structural subtyping
- **Single-Agent Evolution** — Evolve agent instructions, output schemas, and generation configs using training sets and scorers
- **Multi-Agent Evolution** — `evolve_group()` and `evolve_workflow()` for multi-agent and workflow topology evolution
- **Pareto Frontier** — Multi-objective optimization tracking across evolution runs
- **ADK 1.20.0+ Compatibility** — Supports google-adk 1.20.0 through latest with version-adaptive imports
- **CI Quality Gates** — Automated testing (85% coverage), type checking (ty), docstring coverage (interrogate + docvet), boundary enforcement, and protocol coverage
- **12 Architecture Decision Records** — Documented design decisions across domain, testing, logging, and integration

For detailed version history, see individual release tags in the repository.
```

### Project Structure Notes

- No source code changes (`src/` untouched)
- No test changes (`tests/` untouched)
- All changes are in CI config, docs, and project metadata
- Alignment with standard open-source convention (main as default branch)

### Implementation Review Consensus (Party Mode — 2026-03-04)

**Full-panel review by Winston, Bob, Amelia, Murat, Paige:**

1. **Release strategy confirmed.** 1B.6 → 1.0.0, 1B.5 → 1.0.1 (patch), Epic 2 → feature bumps. Phase 1 PR is the last PR to `develop`. `bump-minor-pre-major` removal in Phase 1 is safe.

2. **ACs expanded.** Added AC 11 (`develop` branch cleanup + open PR migration) and AC 12 (post-migration CI verification on `main`). Original 10 ACs were missing explicit develop retention/cleanup policy.

3. **Documentation scope expanded.** Added `README.md` badge check, `mkdocs.yml` `edit_uri` check, `pyproject.toml` URL check, and comprehensive final sweep (Task 7.5). Original sweep only covered `docs/` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

4. **`.claude/rules/pull-requests.md` flagged as highest-impact change.** This file controls dev agent PR targeting. If not updated, Story 1B.5's dev agent will create PRs to the dead `develop` branch. Promoted from "check if present" to "CRITICAL: must update".

5. **CHANGELOG foundation content drafted.** Dev agent has starting content for Task 4.2 instead of inventing from scratch. Covers all major 0.x architectural decisions.

6. **Phase 2 hardened.** Added CI verification task (Task 11) — push bootstrap commit and verify all 8 workflows fire green. Added release-please ref cleanup check. Develop cleanup (Task 12) made explicit with specific commands.

7. **Phase 1 task parallelism noted.** Tasks 1-6 are independent (different files). Dev agent can execute in any order. Only Task 7 (validation) depends on completion of all prior tasks.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Opus 4.6 (claude-opus-4-6)

### Debug Log References

N/A — no debugging required. All changes were mechanical branch-name replacements.

### Completion Notes List

- Phase 1 tasks 1-7 complete. All CI workflows, dependabot, release-please config, documentation, and internal tooling refs updated from `develop` to `main`.
- Additional files found during sweep: `.github/prompts/` (Copilot custom prompts) and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` were not in original task list but contained `develop` branch refs. Updated as Tasks 6.6-6.9.
- Pre-existing flaky test `test_frontier_update_performance_budget` failed during validation — unrelated to this story (zero src/test changes). Coverage 89.26%.
- `release-please-config.json`: added `initial-version: "1.0.0"` in addition to removing pre-major bump settings.
- `.github/instructions/mermaid.instructions.md` contains `develop` in a generic gitGraph syntax example — intentionally left unchanged (not project-specific).
